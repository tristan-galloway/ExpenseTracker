# Overview

I am writing this project in Java as part of my personal goal to learn more languages to code in and building my experience in various languages. I will be showing what I've learned so far about using variables, conditionals, classes, methods, ArrayLists, encapsulation, modularization, functions, and loops.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
